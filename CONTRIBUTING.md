# Contributing to nosfry

This document covers how to develop, test, and release nosfry. Please read it
before opening a pull request.

## Principles

- Prefer small, reviewable pull requests with a clear problem statement.
- Every protocol decision lives in `nosfry-core`, which stays sans-IO: no async
  runtime, no I/O, no clock, no randomness. The runtimes only execute the
  commands it emits.
- Both editions share behavior. A change to relay semantics lands in both the
  native server and the Workers edition, with a case in the conformance suite.
- Remove obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers. Choose the
  simplest implementation that fully meets the requirement.
- Every queue, buffer, scan, and session set is bounded.

## Prerequisites

| Tool                    | Notes                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rust                    | The pinned toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`) plus nightly for fmt and clippy   |
| `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | Target for `nosfry-core`, `nosfry-sql`, and `nosfry-worker`                    |
| clang with wasm32       | `CC_wasm32_unknown_unknown`, for libsecp256k1 (e.g. `brew install llvm`)       |
| `cargo-deny`            | License, ban, and advisory checks                                              |
| Node                    | `npx` runs taplo and wrangler                                                  |
| `worker-build` 0.8.7    | Workers edition builds (`cargo install worker-build --version 0.8.7 --locked`) |
| `just`                  | Optional task runner (`Justfile`)                                              |

## Local gate

Run before every pull request; CI runs the same checks.

```bash
npx --yes @taplo/cli@0.7.0 fmt --check
cargo +nightly fmt --all -- --check
cargo +nightly clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
cargo deny check
CC_wasm32_unknown_unknown="$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang" \
    cargo check -p nosfry-core -p nosfry-sql -p nosfry-worker --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
CC_wasm32_unknown_unknown="$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang" \
    cargo clippy -p nosfry-worker --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -- -D warnings
```

The black-box conformance suite runs the same cases against both editions:

```bash
crates/nosfry-conformance/run.sh native
crates/nosfry-conformance/run.sh worker
```

Longer checks before a release:

```bash
NOSFRY_CRASH_CYCLES=60 cargo test -p nosfry --test crash
cargo +nightly fuzz run <target> -- -max_total_time=600
```

## Layout

```text
crates/
  nosfry-core/         sans-IO protocol core (native + wasm32)
  nosfry-lmdb/         LMDB event store
  nosfry/              native relay binary
  nosfry-sql/          SQL event store for Durable Object SQLite (native + wasm32)
  nosfry-worker/       Cloudflare Workers edition
  nosfry-testkit/      reference model and shared store differential suite
  nosfry-conformance/  URL-driven black-box suite for both editions
fuzz/                  cargo-fuzz targets
bench/                 benchmark and soak harnesses
```

## Testing rules

- A new store behavior goes into the shared differential suite in
  `nosfry-testkit`, so LMDB and SQL are checked against the same model. The
  model encodes the native rule and never adapts to make a store pass.
- A new client-visible behavior gets a conformance case that passes on both
  editions. Tests never rely on ordering across two connections; an
  impossible-filter `REQ` on the first connection is the barrier.
- Commit proptest regression files.

## Commits and pull requests

- Conventional Commits in English: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`, imperative,
  at most 50 characters, with a body explaining why.
- Record user-visible changes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) under
  `[Unreleased]`.
- Never commit secrets. `docs/` is local-only and gitignored.

## Releases

Maintainers only.

1. CI is green on `main`, and the crash and fuzz runs above pass.
2. Move the `[Unreleased]` notes in `CHANGELOG.md` into a dated version section.
3. Bump the workspace `version` and the path dependency versions in the root
   `Cargo.toml`.
4. Tag and push: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
5. Confirm the `release` (binaries), `publish` (crates.io: `nosfry-core`,
   `nosfry-lmdb`, `nosfry`), and `container` (`ghcr.io/qntx/nosfry`) workflows
   succeed.
